          <h2>Artist: Chad Caswell</h2>
          <img src="img/teddybear/chad.jpg" alt="Heather with Driscoll" />
          <p>Chad started sculpting with clay early on in life, as soon as he was old enough to realize it wasn't something to eat.</p>

          <p>"I grew up around art, and it became a way for me to turn my imagination into something physical," he said. "My mom and dad worked in a gallery, its where we were raised."</p>

          <p>Now, Chad enjoys the combination of technology with sculpting, using digital programs to create his pieces on a computer screen.</p>

          <p>"It's not much different from the standard process, just that the lump of clay is on a screen," Chad said. "I've been trying to grow that industry and help other artists."</p>

          <p>Chad's favorite piece was a monument he made for McMinnville â€” a statue honoring World War II veteran Leonard DeWitt. DeWitt served in Japan, and was nominated for the Medal of Honor for his heroism during the war. For Chad, it was a special project because he met with DeWitt while sculpting the piece. He made the statue when he was 20 years old, the same age DeWitt was when he served overseas.</p>
