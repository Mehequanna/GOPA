            <p>
            Madison is an artist who lives in Portland, Oregon. He started painting murals and 
            large scale work in high school and since then has painted murals all over the world. 
            When getting to design his own murals, he often chooses to paint subject matter such 
            as plants, animals, and other things that are significant to the location of the piece. 
            His style can best be described as illustrative folk art inspired by contemporary design.
