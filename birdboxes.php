            <p>
            Madison is an artist who lives in Portland, Oregon. He started painting murals and 
            large scale work in high school and since then has painted murals all over the world. 
            When getting to design his own murals, he often chooses to paint subject matter such 
            as plants, animals, and other things that are significant to the location of the piece. 
            His style can best be described as illustrative folk art inspired by contemporary design.

            <h2 class="text-center">Artist: Ricardo Alvarez</h2>
            <p>
                Mr. Alvarez has experience in branding and logo work, clothing design,
                print making, screen printing, sticker making, and murals.
            </p>
            <p>
                He has traveled extensively and has lived in Central Mexico, the Portland
                area and Seattle. Gresham has been home since 2012, longer than any
                other city.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mr. Alvarez was a brewer and part-time graphic artist until the brewery
                where he worked closed in 2019. He had just started on a new career path
                when Covid-19 struck in 2020, and his options became more limited. With a
                sudden surplus of time and creative energy, he began to focus more on his
                art and to explore different ways to use his talents. Having been a graffiti
                artist for decades, he was always interested in public art and murals and
                their ability to be public education tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                He says his 8-year-old daughter has inspired him in a big way and started
                him thinking about how to get her and other children more excited about
                the world around them. When she has a question, finding an answer also
                teaches him something new. Many exciting journeys begin with questions,
                and Mr. Alvarez sees art as a great way to stimulate curiosity and even
                more questions.
