                Gresham residents, Maryann and Jack Mendez, recently gave their
                time to advise GOPA on how to modify the Braille inscriptions on
                public art plaques in Historic Downtown Gresham. They visited
                "Teddy" and other sites, where plaques are currently installed,
                and provided recommendations on how to make the Braille more descriptive,
                as well as how to better position the plaques in relation to the art.
                GOPA will now have the plaques redone to reflect Maryann and
                Jack's much appreciated insights.

          <br>
          <p>Driscoll (the guide dog statue), Main Street Mural, and Family Ties (GOPA provided the brick platform) were featured in the Gresham Area Chamber of Commerce video! The art is shown just after 2:35 in the video. Definitely watch the whole video to get a great look at what Gresham, Oregon has to offer.</p>
