                What happens when you put 3 incredible women led organizations together? You get downtown Gresham's first ever Indigenous Arts Festival! Silvie Andrews with Gresham Historical Society, Judy Han with Gresham Outdoor Public Art, and Lluvia Merello with Portland's Indigenous Marketplace came together to bring Native art, music, dancing, crafts, and Indigenous joy to Gresham's Main Street.

                Over 800 attendees were able to peruse 30+ Indigenous vendors. Turquoise Pride and two Champion Powwow Dancers wowed large audiences with their music and dancing. During the performance they shared their stories, culture, and even taught attendees a dance.
