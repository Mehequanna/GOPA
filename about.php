          <br>
          <h4>Our Goal:</h4>
          <p>To obtain and install locally crafted, permanent outdoor art for Gresham, which will contribute to ongoing educational and cultural experiences and cultivate appreciation of what visual, touchable art can do to enrich our imaginations, our lives and our community.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Our Beginning:</h4>
          <p>Art Walk Etc. is a 501.c3 volunteer organization made up of individuals and supporters who work together to build community, using art as the vehicle. Our first project was the Gresham Art Walk in 2002, created by a small group of volunteers who loved art â€“ all kinds of art! What began as a showcase for a handful of artists became THE Gresham event to attend on the third Saturday in July, ultimately drawing as many as 20,000 attendees to downtown Gresham each year. The desire to support more permanent, smaller scale art projects led to the organization's gifting the Art Walk event to the City of Gresham after a one-year mentorship in 2014. With that, Gresham Outdoor Public Art (GOPA) was born to bring art into public spaces as a permanent legacy to enrich and enhance the community.</p>
